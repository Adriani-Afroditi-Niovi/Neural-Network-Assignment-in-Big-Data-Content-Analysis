  We are a business intelligence services provider that has been appointed by Airline Company in order to build a model that will classify accurately all tweets that refer to the company and/or its main rivals. The aim of our project is that, the company will decrease its response times in negative tweets or its reactions to the positive ones. At the same time, it will conduct further analysis to the tweets concerning its rivals in order to predict similar negative or positive occurrences that may arise. 
  
  In the current assignment we are utilizing a dataset of 14.640 tweets, each one of them referring explicitly to one major U.S. airline. The most important feature of the dataset that makes it extremely useful is that tweets are already classified between positive, negative or neutral by the contributors. We can use this classification in order to extract the appropriate information so that in the future, we would not need any manual effort to separate negative tweets from positive or neutral. All tweets are coming from February 2015.

We started by making some pre-processing steps, such as data cleaning. After that, we used machine learning techniques (such as Na√Øve Bayes) and at last, we developed deep learning architectures such as the Recurrent Neural Network and the Convolutional Neural Network
